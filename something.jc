    <h1>★Something★</h1>
    <p> I'm not sure what to really talk about here. I'm not that creative. Yeah...it sucks. Maybe I can show off a drawing I've made. </p>

    <h2>★My Drawing★</h2>
    <img src="Kimiko.jpg" alt="Kimiko"
    width="200"
    height="300"/>
    <p> This is just one of many drawings that I've made. I doodle a lot of animal themed drawings, which is known as "furries." Being a furry means that you are interested in anthropormorphic animals and do activities involving them. Anyways...</p>

    <h3>★Anime★</h3>
    <p>Anime is something very interesting. It is a big reason why I'm so interested in Japanese culture; they're very creative.

    <p> This is a character from the popular anime called Boku no Hero Academia (My Hero Academia in English). The show is very action based, similar to Dragon Ball Z, another really popular anime.</p>

    <p> This is a character from Dragon Ball Super; her name is Android 18 and she has been around since Dragon Ball Z.</p>
    <h4>★The End★</h4>
    <p>So, that's all I could think about to say. I hope you enjoyed reading and...here's <a href="magicalmiku.gif">a magical Hatsune Miku!</a>
